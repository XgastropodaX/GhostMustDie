# GhostMustDie
A very very late project
# Ghost Must Die
I had so much ambition going into this project. I wanted to do a short series of comics and i made a bunch of original spritework for the game. But just so much happened and I wasn't able to make it what I wanted. But I think I'm still proud of this. At the very least I have learned a lot. I think I'm most definitely going to finish this eventually its just not in the cards right now.

## Future Development
Its gunna happen. I had such a good idea for this. I explored this a lot more in the game jam project which was a lot closer to what I imagined this to be.
